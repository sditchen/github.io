    <h1>
    San Francisco: The Best and the Worst
    </h1>
    <h2>
    The best neighborhood is the <strong><em>Mission!</em></strong>
    </h2>

    <p>
    I love the Mission because of how distinct its buildings are. You see the classic San Francisco <strong>Victorian/Edwardian-style</strong> homes in the side streets, but also see the vibrant street art and graffiti that's plastered all over walls.

    The food here is also one of the citys' treasures&mdash;it's flavors ranging from <em>Mexican street food, Peruvian and Salvadorian dishes,</em> to even <em>Chinese and Thai</em> delicacies. This neighborhood is one of the prime examples of melting pot communities here in the city, as well as cuisine fusions. I love being so close to many different kinds of people and their cultures spilling into one area.
    </p>
    <h2>
    The worst neighbordhood is the <strong><em>Tenderloin.</em></strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
    Though the Tenderloin was known for its bustling nightlife of theater, gambling, "speakeasies" and diverse gender and cultural communities starting in the 1920s, today it is hard to miss the homelessness, garbage and tracks of drug life layered in the corners of its streets. Glimmers of its life in <strong>diversity</strong> is hidden in its mixture of the rich and poor communities where food brings people together again. <em>"Little Saigon"</em> holds few of the authentic and affordable Vietnamese/Hmong food. Near City Hall showcases all forms of classical entertainment, such as theater, opera, ballet and jazz. Though I appreciate the Tenderloins' historical background and diverse community, I can't help but feel sorry for the ones who are left behind in its derelict state, long removed from its glitzy and care-free hey-days.
