    <h1>My Favorite Food</h1>

    <h2>Salmon Sashimi (Donburi-style)</h2>

    <p>
    My favorite food consists of different types of raw seafood, like sushi. It is the reason why one of my nicknames is <em>"Sushi"</em>, and what I imagine to be my perfect meal after a long day. It leaves me full and comforted with a belly full of warm rice. There are many ways to eat salmon <em>sashimi</em>, or raw pieces of fish served with soy sauce and wasabi. In this case, it will be served with rice, my <em>favorite</em> way to eat it, so technically is called salmon <em>donburi</em>, meaning rice bowl. I will describe how I like to enjoy salmon sashimi down in the recipe below. â˜º
